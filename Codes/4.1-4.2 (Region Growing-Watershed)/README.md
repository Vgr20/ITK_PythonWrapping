# Medical Image Segmentation with ITK

This project provides a segmentation pipeline for medical images using the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK).

## Project Files

### Images

- **eyeball.jpg**: A  anatomical image of an eyeball section, showcasing various structures within the eye.
- **brainprotondensity.jpg**: An MRI proton density image of the brain, showing the internal structures of the brain in detail.

These images are provided as sample inputs for segmentation tasks.

### Document

- **Segmentation with ITK.pdf**: Contains pdf version of the presentation done in the class. This document covers various techniques and algorithms used within ITK to perform accurate and efficient segmentation on medical images.

### Code

- **Code implementation.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file includes the code implementation for segmenting anatomical structures in medical images using ITK. The code is structured to read, process, and segment medical images, providing visual output at each step for better understanding.


## How to Run

1. Open the `Code implementation.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps to load, process, and segment the sample images.
3. Use the provided guidelines in `Segmentation with ITK.pdf` for detailed instructions on parameter selection and segmentation techniques.
